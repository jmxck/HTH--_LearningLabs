    <h1>The Christian Community</h1>
    <p>I'm a bold believer in christ and theres a very large community of believers in the Bay Area.That community is very confusing from far away ... and close up. Having been born into that community, I've seen the problems, successes, truth, lies, and contrast of it. I myself at one pooint questioned God because of the community and the actions of the poeple. Some christians posses an "Us and Them" mindset that deters potential believers from turning their lives to Jesus. I also had dark moments that none of my christian counterparts could really help with and no prayer really helped. I doubted God and the community made it leaps and bounds worse. I now am strong in my faith for 2 years after being far from Jesus Christ for two to three years. The way I came back . . . for another time ;| </p>
